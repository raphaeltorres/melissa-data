melissa-data
============

Simple class to allow you to easily verify an address with Melissa Data service.  

While this class is not complete for all of the Websmart endpoints, it is a starting point for what I'm doing.  This is meant to be a codeigniter library.

Simply put this file in the "libraries" folder of your codeigniter project.  Then, create a class to extend the library.  

Pretty simple.

@todo:

-add other websmart endpoints
-abstract the array_to_xml method
-put cURL call back in (couldn't use cURL for the project I was working on)
